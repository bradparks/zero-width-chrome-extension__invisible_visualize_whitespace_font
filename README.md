# Replace zero-width characters with emojis

I built this purely for fun, inspired by [this article](https://medium.com/@umpox/be-careful-what-you-copy-invisibly-inserting-usernames-into-text-with-zero-width-characters-18b4e6f17b66).

You can install it as an "unpacked" extension or [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/replace-zero-width-charac/lgaiigbekmcejmhenhhleeaicbcjjddi).

Here's a short GIF of how it works:
